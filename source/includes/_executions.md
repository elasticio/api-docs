#Scheduled Executions

## Preamble
In order to set up usage of some component in a certain `node` in certain `Flow`, some available configuration options could not be described in advance, because they depend on the context in each case.

Let's consider an example when we have a component with a module, which allows retrieving a list of goods from some e-commerce platform.
In this case, we have few configuration parameters, which should be configured in order to use a component in some flow, but all available options are different for different e-commerce installations.

The first such "dynamic" parameter is a category of a good. Each installation has its own set of goods categories.

Goods in different categories have different attributes set, so the structure of data in messages (metadata), produced by the module is dependent on selected category. So metadata also should be retrieved for each case.

And finally, each client uses own credential in order to connect connector with the e-commerce platform installation. Credential parameters have to be verified somehow before usage (at least in order to avoid confusing bugs while using component). 


In order to solve each of three problems above, there are so-called scheduled executions, which allow running special methods of a component.
  
These methods are:


- `selectModel` allows retrieving available options for certain parameter of configuration, when component/module is used in some node in some flow
- `getMetaModel` allows retrieving metadata for certain configuration of some node of some flow
- `verifyCredentials` allows verifying if a configuration of credential of a certain component is valid


Each of the methods is executed in the same environment as a module of a component while executing of flows.  


## Scheduled execution workflow

A component execution is an asynchronous operation. Upon an client request an execution is scheduled
and needs to wait for the next available worker. Once a worker is available the component is executed
and the results are sent back to the client. Because the results of an execution cannot be created and
returned immediately the client needs to wait and poll for the results.


For more details about asynchronous REST please read [RESTful CookBook](http://restcookbook.com/Resources/asynchroneous-operations/)
and [A day in the life of - Asynchronous operations in REST](https://www.adayinthelifeof.nl/2011/06/02/asynchronous-operations-in-rest/).


The following diagram displays the process of component scheduling:

1. A method execution is scheduled by sending a request corresponding endpoint (see below). The API responds with ``202 Accepted``. 
The resource in the ``Location`` HTTP header is the URL to poll for execution results.
2. The execution result is polled periodically by sending requests to the polling resource``exec/poll/{EXECUTION_ID}``. 
The API responds with ``200 OK`` if the result is not available yet.
3. Once the result is available the polling resource responds with ``303 See Other``. The resource in the ``Location`` 
HTTP header is the URL to get the results of the execution.
4. The results are retrieved from ``exec/result/{EXECUTION_ID}``.

TODO â€“ update and paste time sequence diagram.
