# Introduction

Welcome to the {{ product_name }} [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer)
API documentation v2. It adheres to the [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) specifications:

*   Returns JSON-encoded responses (Content-Type: `application/json`),
*   Uses standard HTTP [response codes](#errors)
*   Uses authentication - **You can not use this API without registering at {{ product_name }} platform to get the [authentication](#authentication) credentials.**


## Authentication

We use a standard [HTTP Basic Authtentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
mechanism to authenticate each API call with the {{ product_name }}.

*   `{EMAIL}` - **email address** you use to login to the platform.
*   `{APIKEY}` - a unique **API Key** generated for you found in the profile settings page.

> Example Request:

```shell
curl {{ api_base_url }}/v2/users/me \
   -u {EMAIL}:{APIKEY}
```

> Example Response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "data": {
        "id": "USER_ID",
        "type": "user",
        "links": {
            "self": "/v2/users/USER_ID"
        },
        "attributes": {
            "first_name": "FIRST_NAME",
            "last_name": "LAST_NAME",
            "email": "EMAIL",
            "company": "COMPANY_NAME",
            "registered": "REGISTRATION_DATE",
            "last_login": "LAST_LOGIN_DATE"
        }
    },
    "meta": {}
}
```

## Errors

The {{ product_name }} API uses conventional HTTP response codes to inform the
requester about the success or failure of an API calls. Generally: Codes in the
`2xx` range mean success. Codes in the `4xx` range mean an error that failed given
the information provided. Codes in the `5xx` range mean an error with the
{{ product_name }} platform:
