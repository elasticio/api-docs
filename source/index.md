# Introduction

Welcome to elastic.io. This documentation is a full reference for the REST API documentation v2.
The API implements the [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) specification. We encourage the reader to familiarise himself
with the details of the [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) specification.


## Authentication

You authenticate to the elastic.io API by providing your API key in the request.

Authentication to the API occurs via [HTTP Basic Auth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). Provide your email as the basic auth username and API key as the password.

```shell
curl https://api.elastic.io/v2/users/me \
   -u {EMAIL}:{APIKEY}
```
