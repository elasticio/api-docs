# Introduction

The docs are generated with [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate).


 


# Generating API docs

``cd api``

First you need to install the dependencies, if not yet done.

````bash
Igors-Mac:api igor$ bundle install
````

Once you have them, regenerate the docs by invoking:

````bash
Igors-Mac:api igor$ rake build
````
